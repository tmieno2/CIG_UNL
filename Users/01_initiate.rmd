# Preparation

Load packages and source functions

```{r}
source(here::here("Functions/prepare.R"))
```

# Create new field parameter entries

Modify the entries of the following code and run.

```{r}
initiate_fp_entry(
  farm = "MMUR",
  field = "1",
  year = 2023,
  crop = "wheat"
)
```

You now have created 

+ a basic json entry for this experiment
+ folders 
+ R programs to to 
  1. add input, Rx, and extra information to the **metadata.json** file for this experiment
  2. process datasets you specified in the json file in the step above

# Next steps

1. Go to the **DataProcessingReport** folder and find **add_information.rmd** to add input, Rx, and extra information to the **metadata.json** file for this experiment 

2. Go to the **DataProcessingReport** folder and find **process_data.rmd** to process and combine datasets
